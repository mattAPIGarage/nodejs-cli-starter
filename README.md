# Nodejs CLI starter
13-Jul-2019

A simple nodejs based CLI starter, so you can tell your Python friends nodejs can do it too (maybe not as good as *wheel* or *egg*)

Ref: [Using Node.js to Create Powerful, Beautiful, User-Friendly CLIs](https://nodesource.com/blog/node-js-powerful-beautiful-clis)

To play with it (after npm install ... )
$ ./cli.sh

or to show help ...
$ ./cli.sh -h

The interactive prompt is based on the missing commandline options.
