# Nodejs CLI starter

13-Jul-2019

A simple nodejs based CLI starter, so you can tell your Python friends nodejs can do it too (maybe not as good as _wheel_ or _egg_)

## Ref

- [Using Node.js to Create Powerful, Beautiful, User-Friendly CLIs](https://nodesource.com/blog/node-js-powerful-beautiful-clis)
- [Bundle your Node app to a single executable for Windows, Linux and OsX](https://dev.to/jochemstoel/bundle-your-node-app-to-a-single-executable-for-windows-linux-and-osx-2c89)

To play with it (after npm install ... )
\$ ./cli.sh

or to show help ...
\$ ./cli.sh -h

The interactive prompt is based on the missing commandline options.

## TODO

- add example on using cli-table, cli-spinner, and chalk
